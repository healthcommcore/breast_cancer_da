                  <p>There is a risk of surgical complications, such as infection and wound healing problems, which is increased with a more extensive surgery<span className={ isVisible }>, such as a mastectomy vs a lumpectomy</span>. Complication risks are increased with additional surgery, such as reconstruction.</p>
     <p>Some women who have mastectomies report that their body image and self-image are negatively affected after a mastectomy, even after having breast reconstruction. Some women report that their sexuality is impacted in the years after their mastectomy.  </p>

     <p>Breastfeeding in the other breast will still be possible after a mastectomy.</p>
     <p>After a mastectomy, you will still need a mammogram for the other breast.</p>

              </AccordionItemTitle>
              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>Because your surgeon will be removing the breast tissue right up to the skin of the breast, the sensory nerves are affected, and most women have permanent numbness in the breast and chest wall and nipple area of the treated breast (from your collarbone to the top of your rib cage on the side with the tumor). </p>
     <p>The surgery will leave scars on the breast skin that will fade over time. </p>
     <p>With a mastectomy, the appearance of your breasts/breast area will be asymmetrical (both sides will not look the same).</p>
     <p>Some women choose to have breast reconstruction to help restore the look and feel of the breast that was removed. Reconstruction may be done at the same time as the mastectomy (immediate) or later (delayed). Learn more about breast reconstruction in the section below (under "Other procedures").</p>
     <p>Women who do not have breast reconstruction may choose to be fitted for a breast prosthesis (or breast form made of silicone gel, foam, or other materials) that can be placed in a bra and worn under clothes. <a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/for-patients-and-families/care-and-treatment/support-services-and-amenities/friends-place/services-and-programs/breast-prostheses-and-bras/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Learn more about a prosthesis. </a></p>
     <p>Some women don’t want additional surgery or to deal with special bras, magnets, or adhesive patches that hold a prosthesis in place. They choose no reconstruction and don’t wear a breast form. </p>
     <p>The decision to reconstruct or not is very personal. There is no "right way" to approach mastectomy and reconstruction (or lack of it). There is only the way that is best for you, your preferences, and your healing. </p>

              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>While recovery from a mastectomy is different for everyone, in general, women who have a mastectomy:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Stay overnight at the hospital following their surgery, with a longer stay for tissue-based reconstruction</li>
<li>Can expect to have surgical drains (tubes with a bag attached to capture extra fluid from the surgical site) placed during their surgery to drain extra fluid. This is temporary; the surgeon will take the drains out in about 1 to 2 weeks.</li>
<li>Can usually get back to their regular activities in about 2 to 3 weeks, unless choosing to have reconstruction at the time of the mastectomy, which can prolong the recovery time. Some activities, like exercise, may take longer to get back to.</li>

              </AccordionItemTitle>
              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>After a mastectomy, the risk of the breast cancer returning in the <strong>treated</strong> breast and chest wall area over the next 5 years is about <strong>2 to 4%.</strong> This means that, on average, about <strong>2 to 4 of every 100 women</strong> who choose this treatment for their breast cancer will have their breast cancer come back in their treated breast and chest wall area. </p>
									<p className="accordion-container"><img className="content-img" alt="Illustration showing 100 women with 4 of them highlighted" src={ mastTreated } srcSet={ mastTreated2x } /></p>
                 
    
                  <p>After a mastectomy, the risk of breast cancer developing in the <strong>unaffected (other)</strong> breast in the next 5 years is about <strong>2 to 3%.</strong> This means that, on average, about <strong>2 to 3 of every 100 women</strong> who choose this treatment for their breast cancer will develop cancer in their other breast.</p> 
    
									<p className="accordion-container"><img className="content-img" alt="Illustration showing 100 women, 3 of which are highlighted" src={ mastUnaffected } srcSet={ mastUnaffected2x } /></p>
									<p className={ isVisible }><strong>This 2 to 3% risk of breast cancer developing in the other breast is the same whether a woman has a lumpectomy or mastectomy.</strong></p>
                 
									<p className={ isVisible }>The risk of cancer coming back in another part of the body is the same whether you have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.</p>
                  
    <p><strong>Genetics and cancer risk</strong><br />
There are genetic changes (mutations) that may increase your risk of developing a second breast cancer in the future. If you test positive for one of these mutations, your lifetime risk of developing a new breast cancer can be much higher compared to someone who tests negative for a mutation. This risk will depend on the type of mutation you have. If you test positive for one of these mutations, your doctor or a genetic counselor will discuss these risks with you and help you decide what treatment is right for you.</p>

              <AccordionItemBody>
                  <p>Mastectomy does not eliminate the risk of cancer recurring in the remaining tissues of the chest wall or lymph nodes. In some cases, women who have a mastectomy also have a course of radiation treatment to decrease the risk of cancer returning in the treated breast and chest wall area. Radiation treatment is given to the treated breast area and sometimes to the lymph node regions nearby.</p>
     <p>The radiation treatment usually involves 5 clinical visits each week for 3 to 6 weeks. Each treatment itself is about 10 to 20 minutes. You will not feel anything when you are getting radiation treatment. After the treatment session is over, you can continue your regular activities. It is safe to be around other people after this treatment, including children.</p>
     <p>Most women tolerate radiation treatment well and experience few side effects, but side effects are possible.</p>
		 <ul>
			<li>Common side effects include sunburn to the chest, irritation or itchiness of the chest skin from the radiation, and fatigue.</li>
			<li>Most side effects from radiation treatment are short term.</li>
